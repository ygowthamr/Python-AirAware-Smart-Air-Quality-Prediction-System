# AirAware – Smart Air Quality Prediction System

## Problem Statement
Air pollution has become a serious concern affecting human health and the environment. Continuous monitoring and prediction of air quality is essential to reduce risks and support preventive actions.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to predict air quality levels using machine learning techniques by analyzing historical air pollution data and presenting insights in a user-friendly format.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Dataset
The project uses an air quality dataset containing key pollutant parameters such as:
- PM2.5  
- PM10  
- NO2  
- SO2  
- CO  

## System Architecture
Input Data → Data Cleaning & Preprocessing → ML Model Training → AQI Prediction → Visualization Output

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python Dashboard.py

## future scope
